LIF Meanfield Tools
====================

This Python package provides useful tools for analyzing neuronal networks
consisting of leaky integrate-and-fire (LIF) neurons. These tools are based on
mean-field theory of neuronal networks. That is why this package is called
__lif_meanfield_tools (LMT)__.

The package provides implementations used in the same or a similar version in 
the following scientific publications: [Fourcaud & Brunel (2002)](https://doi.org/10.1162/089976602320264015), 
[Schuecker et al. (2014)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1410.8799),
[Schuecker et al. (2015)](https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevE.92.052119),
[Schuecker et al. (2017)]( https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005179),
[Bos et al. (2016)](https://dx.doi.org/10.1371%2Fjournal.pcbi.1005132) and
Senk et al. ("Conditions for wave trains in spiking neural networks", accepted for
publication in Physical Review Research).

Using this package, you can easily calculate quantities like firing rates, power
spectra, and many more, which give you a deeper and more intuitive understanding
of what your network does. If your network is not behaving the way you want it
to, these tools might help you to figure out, or even tell you, what you need to
change in order to achieve the desired behaviour. It is easy to store
(and in the future, to plot) results and reuse them for further analyses.

The package is alive. We are continuously trying to improve and simplify its
usage.

# Structure

<img src="https://github.com/INM-6/lif_meanfield_tools/blob/master/readme_figures/structure_new.png" width="400">        

lif_meanfield_tools consists of four modules:

- The central module is __network.py__. It defines a class `Network` which is a
  container for network parameters, analysis parameters and calculated results.
  `Network` comes with all the methods that can be used to calculate network
  properties, like firing rates or power spectra. Additionally,
  there are some 'administrative' methods for changing parameters or saving.

- __input_output.py__ is called by `network.py` for everything that is related to
  input or output. Here we defined saving and loading routines, quantity format
  conversions and hash creation.

- __meanfield_calcs.py__ is the module which is called every time a mean-field
  related method of `Network` is called. Here we put all the mathematical details
  of the mean-field theory.

- __aux_calcs.py__ is a module where auxiliary calculations that are needed in
  `meanfield_calcs.py` are defined. These functions are supposed to be generic,
  non-specific building blocks. However, it is difficult to draw a line between
  the calculations that belong to `meanfield_calcs.py` and the ones that belong to
  `aux_calcs.py`.

```

# Current Issues

As the package is still maturing, we currently have some issues that you should
be aware of:

- [__Network model used__](https://github.com/INM-6/lif_meanfield_tools/issues/36):
  Currently, the toolbox is specialized on the microcircuit model (first
  published by [Potjans and Diesmann (2014)](https://doi.org/10.1093/cercor/bhs358))
  which is why the network parameter `label` should only be set to
  `microcircuit` at the moment. See the function
  `_calculate_dependent_network_parameters()` in `network.py`.

- [__Firing rates can become negative__](https://github.com/INM-6/lif_meanfield_tools/issues/19):
  It happened once to us that the firing rates we got were negative for a
  specific set of network parameters. Apparently, the algorithm is running into
  a non-realistic local minimum. This is an issue we will deal with soon.

- [__Accuracy of transfer function at high frequencies__](https://github.com/INM-6/lif_meanfield_tools/issues/37):
  This actually is not a real issue, but you should be aware that the current
  implementation is only accurate for moderate frequencies. This is expected
  from the theory implemented. In the future we might add a support for high
  frequencies (see [Schuecker et al. (2015)](https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevE.92.052119) 
  for further discussion).

- [__Accuracy of transfer function depends on ratio of synaptic and membrane time
  constant__](https://github.com/INM-6/lif_meanfield_tools/issues/37): This
  is a part of the theory as well. It is only accurate for small values of
  <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\sqrt{\tau_s/\tau_m}">
  which is used as a perturbation parameter in the analysis (see 
  [Schuecker et al. (2015)](https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevE.92.052119) for 
  further discussion).

# How to Use This Package

In order to give you a quick and simple start, we wrote some example scripts in
the folder `examples`. You can start with `minimal_usage_example.py`.
First of all, you should have a look at this
file. Actually, we hope that the usage might be self-explanatory, once you have
seen an example. But, if you need a little more hints, just continue reading.

For using LMT, you need to store all your network parameters and your analysis
parameters in .yaml files, as we have done it for the example script. If you
don't know how the .yaml file format works, you could either first read something
about it, or use our example .yaml files as templates.

So, let us start coding. First of all you need to import the package itself.
Additionally, you might want to define a variable to store the `pint` unit
registry (ureg). This is needed for dealing with units and some of the
functionality implemented needs the usage of pint units.

Now, you can instantiate a network by calling the central LMT class `Network`
and passing the .yaml file names. A `Network` object represents your network. When
it is instantiated, it first calculates all the parameters that are derived from
the passed parameters. Then, it stores all the parameters associated with the
network under consideration. Additionally, it checks whether these parameters
have been used for an analysis before, and if so loads the corresponding
results. Newly calculated results are stored withing the `Network` object as well.

A `Network` object has the ability to tell you about it's properties, simply by
calling the corresponding method as
```
	network.<property>()
```
Here, `<property>` can be replaced by lots of stuff, like for example
`firing_rates`, `transfer_function`, or `power_spectra`. You can find the
complete list of `Network` methods at the end of this section. When such a method
is called, the network first checks whether this quantity has been calculated
before. If so, it returns the stored value. If not, it does the calculations,
stores the results, and returns them.

Sometimes, you might want to know a property for some specific parameter, like
for example the `power_spectra` at a certain frequency. Then, you need to pass
the parameter including its unit to the method, e.g.,
```
	network.power_spectra(10 * ureg.Hz)
```
If you want to save your results, you can simply call
```
	network.save()
```
and the calculated results, together with the corresponding parameters, will be
stored inside a .h5 file, whose name contains a hash, which reflects the used
network parameters.

Network methods:
- __save__: Save all calculated results together with network and analysis
  parameters into an .h5 file.
- __show__: Return a list of quantities that have already been calculated.
- __change_parameters__: Create a new instance of Network class with adjusted
  specified parameters.
- __firing_rates__: Calculate the firing rates in a self-consistent mean-field
  manner. The algorithm starts with firing rate zero for all populations, then
  calculates the resulting mean and variance of the input to a neuron, and uses
  the results and Eq. (4.33) in
  [Fourcaud & Brunel (2002)](https://doi.org/10.1162/089976602320264015)
  to calculate the resulting firing rate again. This procedure is continued
  until the rates converge.
- __mean_input__: Calculate mean input to a neuron, given the population firing
  rates and external inputs.
- __std_input__: Calculate the standard deviation of the input to a neuron,
  given the population firing rates and external inputs.
- __working_point__: Return firing rate, mean and standard deviation of input.
- __delay_dist_matrix__: Compute a matrix of prefactors in frequency domain
  dependent on a given delay distribution.
- __transfer_function__: Calculate the transfer function following Eq. (93)
  in
  [Schuecker et al. (2014)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1410.8799)
  in first order perturbation theory in
   <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\sqrt{\tau_s/\tau_m}">,
  the square root of the synaptic time constant divided by the membrane time
  constant. You can choose between two implementations:
  `taylor` and `shift`. The difference is the way the colored noise is treated
  mathematically, which leads to two slightly different  approximations, which
  are however equivalent up to first order (see
  [Schuecker et al. (2015)](https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevE.92.052119)
  for further discussion).
- __sensitivity_measure__: Calculate the sensitivity measure, introduced in
  Eq. (7) of
  [Bos et al. (2016)](https://dx.doi.org/10.1371%2Fjournal.pcbi.1005132),
  which can be used to identify the connections
  crucial for the peak amplitude and frequency of network oscillations, visible
  in the power spectrum.
- __power_spectra__: Calculate the power spectra of all populations following
  Eq. (18) in [Bos et al. (2016)](https://dx.doi.org/10.1371%2Fjournal.pcbi.1005132).
- __eigen_spectra__: Calculate the eigenvalue spectrum, or left of right
  eigenvectors of the effective connectivity matrix (Eq. 4), the propagator
  Eq. (16) or the inverse propagator in the frequency domain as defined in 
  [Bos et al. (2016)](https://dx.doi.org/10.1371%2Fjournal.pcbi.1005132).

The following additional Network methods have been used in Senk et al.
("Conditions for wave trains in spiking neural networks", accepted for
publication in Physical Review Research):
- __additional_rates_for_fixed_input__: Compute external excitatory and
  inhibitory rates to obtain a fixed working point (see Appendix F).
- __fit_transfer_function__: Fit the transfer function with a low-pass filter
  (see Fig. 5(b) and (c)).
- __scan_fit_transfer_function_mean_std_input__: Iterate different combinations
  of mean and standard deviation of input using `fit_transfer_function()`
  (see Fig. 5).  
- __effective_coupling_strength__: Compute the effective coupling strength
  according to Eq. (E1).
- __linear_interpolation_alpha__: Linear interpolation between LIF transfer
  function and low-pass filter (see Fig. 6),
- __eigenvals_branches_rate__: Compute eigenvalues for branches of the
  Lambert W function corresponding to the analytically exact solution of the
  neural-field model (see Fig. 6 for alpha=0).
- __xi_of_k__: Effective spatial profile (see Fig. 3(b) and (d)).
- __solve_chareq_rate_boxcar__: Analytical solution of the characteristic
  equation for a neural-field model with boxcar-shaped connectivity kernels.

# History of this Project

Mean-field theory is a very handy tool when you want to understand the behaviour
of your network. Using this theory allows you to predict some features of a
network without running a single (often very time consuming) simulation.

At our institute, the
[INM-6 at the Research Center Juelich](https://www.fz-juelich.de/inm/inm-6/EN/Home/home_node_INM6.html),
we, among other
things, investigate and develop such mean-field tools. Over the years, more and
more of the tools, developed by ourselves and other researchers, have been
implemented. In particular, the primary work for this package has been done by
Hannah Bos, Jannis Schuecker and Moritz Helias. Here we extend the work
published in the repository [https://github.com/INM-6/neural_network_meanfield]
and make it available to a wider audience.

We restructured and rewrote the code with the aim to make it usable without
having to understand all details of the underlying theory. We simplified
the code. We introduced units and decided to store the parameters in separate
.yaml files. We wanted the users to only have to interact with one module. So, we
collected all the functionality in the `network.py` module. We ported the code to
Python 3. We made the whole thing a package. We expanded the documentation a
lot. We simplified saving results together with the parameters. And so on.

What we ended up with is the package that you are currently interested in. It
contains several tools for analyzing neuronal networks. And it is very simple to
use.
