### neural response
# Transfer function is either calculated analytically ('analytical')
# or approximated by an exponential ('empirical'). In the latter case
# the time constants in response to an incoming impulse ('tau_impulse'),
# as well as the instantaneous rate jumps ('delta_f') have to be
# specified.
